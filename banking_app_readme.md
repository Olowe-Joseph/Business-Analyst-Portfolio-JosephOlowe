##  Why This Project Matters

This UAT project simulates real-world system implementation — requiring not just documentation, but coordination, prioritization, and delivery under pressure.

It proves that I can:
- Design structured test scenarios  
- Communicate with both business and technical teams  
- Track defects and maintain testing discipline  
- Own the UAT process end-to-end
